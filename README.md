# FE interview take-home challenge 1

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Implementation

I apologize for not being able to complete all the required tasks within the allotted time. My experience lies more with Tailwind CSS and a custom library of elements, so I spent additional time reading through Material-UI documentation to understand the best practices for using common components, especially the DataGrid.

Although I have created a basic skeleton for the dropdown, it is not yet functional for filtering. Additionally, the styles for several elements are still incomplete.

I truly enjoyed working on this project, but unfortunately, I couldn't meet the deadline due to unforeseen personal matters that arose during the process. I had to balance those with the algorithm tests and the take-home assignment.

Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to any feedback you may have.
